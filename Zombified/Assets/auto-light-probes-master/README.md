# Automatic Light Probe Placer for Unity
An automatic light probe placement script for Unity that uses the Navmesh for approximating light probe positions.

# How to use

 * Go to Window > Generate Light Probes
 * Assign your object that has a Light Probe Group attached to it.
 * Set the merging distance. Higher merge distances improve generation speed and reduce the number of probes.
 * Press the big button.
 * Enjoy.

The code is ugly as hell, if anyone can make any improvements I'll be glad to accept them.
